# penguins.ipynb README

## About this project 
The *penguins.ipynb* Jupyter notebook contains the project for the Principal of Data Analytics module. 

The project analyses the [Palmers penguin dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) looking at the variables within the dataset. The [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv) version of the data was used for the project.

The notebook utilizes plots such as bar charts, histograms and scatter plots to visulise the data contained within the dataset.

Two of the variables in the dataste will also be analysed and the correlation discussed. For the purpose of this project we will look at the correlation between flipper length and body mass of the penguins.

## Software used: 
This project was created using VS Code, python & GitHub.

### Libaries within python: 
Within the python code we are importing 3 modules at the beginning of the notebook to use throughout.
